Congrats! You've just joined the game, you should see something similar to the picture above if nobody grifted the world.

# **The controls**

*"I know how to play the Cave game, everyone does, stop being annoying"* you might think.

Although yes, most of the game mechanics should be similiar, keep in mind this isn't the Cave game **but a clone** made so it can run as a part of a website so some things do differ.

## **Keyboard**

### **Moving**

You can move around the world by using the following keys:

- "a": Left
- "d": Right
- "w": Forward
- "s": Backward

Or in other words, the standard gaming keys for moving

### **Looking around**

You can look around by holding the left click on your mouse and moving the cursor around the game area.

This one is different from most of the games played in full screen where your mouse would by default be locked in, but here we make you press the left button so that we don't lock in your mouse if you aren't playing the game.

**Wow! Look at you, almost a pro player!**

### **Interacting with the world**

First of all, this is an adventure and you need to ask yourself a question.

*"Am I a destroyer or a creator"* and commence from there. For whatever choice you pick, I'm here to guide you on how to fullfill your purpose.

### **Destroying blocks:**

This one is very simple, if you're in a **proximity** of a block you want to destroy, you just **click** on it with the **left click**

### **Creating blocks:**

So, in the end you've decided that you won't be just a consumer. Good for you.

But like in real life, creation takes a bit more effort but is always worth it in the end

This action consists of multiple steps.

1. Picking a material
    
    ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Yj2tljR.png)
    
    You should be able to see a bar with all material in the top spot of the game. There you can pick any of the materials you wish to place.
    
    Once you've picked one, it's gonna stay until you pick another (ne need to click everytime before placing a block)
    
2. Putting the block in the world
    
    You can do this just by clicking on the spot where you wish to place the new block.
    
    But, don't fool yourself, you're not the God, there are rules to creation:
    
    - You can't put a block further than 4 blocks from you
    - You can't put or destroy blocks in the spawn area

### **Taking Acid**

*"I didn't see this in the Cave game, what is this"* you might think. Well of course you didn't see it, this is WebCave, made with <3 by Acid, so there's gotta be some Acid.

By pressing the button in the bottom right of the game, and taking something free from a suspicious site.

**You get to increase your perception on things**

    1. Press the button **"t"** on your keyboard
    2. Click on the chatting box in the bottom left of the game
